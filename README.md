# Object-Detection-in-Satellite-Imagery-Using-YOLOv3-
This repository provides the experimentation of Object Detection in Satellite Imagery using YOLOv3.
A simple laptop (windows, linux or mac) is all you need for this project, as we will be using Google Colab for training and testing purpose.

1. Dataset Preparation

An image dataset is a folder containing a lot of images (I suggest to get at least 100 of them) where there is the custom object you want to detect. For example Iâ€™m training      YOLO to recognize a Koala, so I have downloaded around 350 images containing Koalas.
